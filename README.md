## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about building intelligent systems using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  
My key focus is in **Natural Language Processing**, **model deployment**, and creating **end-to-end ML applications** that work in real-world scenarios.

🔍 I enjoy working on:
- NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering  
- ML use cases like regression, classification, and fraud detection  
- Deploying interactive apps using **Streamlit** and **Flask**  
- Experimenting with CNNs for image-based projects
