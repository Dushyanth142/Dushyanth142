## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist with **3 years of experience** building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems in **manufacturing, warranty fraud detection, and document analysis**. I specialize in:

- Developing ML pipelines with clean, production-ready code
- Applying Deep Learning (CNNs) to image-based defect detection
- Building NLP models using Transformer-based architectures (Hugging Face)
- Performing feature engineering, model evaluation, and EDA

I love working with data, building tools that make life easier, and learning continuously.
